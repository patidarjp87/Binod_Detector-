 If the price of goods increases by R %, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expenditure can be calculated using the formula:
	R	× 100		%
(100 + R)

(2) If the price of goods decreases by R %, then the increase in consumption so as not to decrease the expenditure can be calculated using the formula:
	R	× 100		%
(100 – R)

2. Numerical on Population: Population of a city at present is P and it increases at the rate of R% per annum.
(1) To find population after n years = P		1 +	R		n
100

-------- (After n years population increases, thus		1 +	R		is used)
100

(2) To find population n years ago =	 
P
	1 +	R		n
100

3. Numerical on Depreciation: Present value of machine is M, If it depreciates at the rate of R% per annum.
(1) To find value of machine after n years = P		1 –	R		n
100

-------- (After n years the value of machine decreases, thus		1 –	R		is used)
100

(2) To find the value of machine n years ago =	 
P
	1 –	R		n
100
